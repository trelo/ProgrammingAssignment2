## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a 
## matrix rather than computing it repeatedly

## The first function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix" object
##that can cache its inverse

##Assumption: The matrix x is invertible.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## `cacheSolve` function computes the inverse of the special 
##"matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
##already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
##`cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  s <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(s)
  s
}
